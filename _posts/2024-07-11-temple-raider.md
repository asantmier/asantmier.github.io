This is a short 3D experience I made as a final project for "Constructing the Moving Image" at Georgia Tech. The project
involved using Unity (C#), Blender, and Photoshop to create a storyboard for the experience, some models for it, and then
making it interactive through Unity. The project is meant to be a complete and polished experience and features complex
models, lighting, and sound effects with an emphasis on visual design. This is also my first ever attempt at character 
modeling and rigging; while I could have used something premade that looked good, I wanted the experience more.

You play the role of an adventurer exploring a jungle temple for treasure, solving simple physics and jumping puzzles
to reach the treasure room, and then dodging deadly traps as you escape. There is a cutscene midway through the
adventure which was a learning process for me as I had never done that in a project before. This was also my first
experience with level design focused on the visuals of the experience rather than the mechanics. I had to design a 
system to divide the level into sections and shape the level such that the player could only ever see a few sections
at a time so that the others could be disabled to maintain performance. The player character's model is handmade and
rigged to an animated skeleton I ripped off of a Unity demo. Considering I had no prior experience with character 
modeling, nor retargeting animations from one model to another, I learned a lot in that process and I'm proud of the 
result. I also learned a lot about streamlining Unity's import process for models, lighting, performance debugging,
and how Unity's rendering system works. This project is full of firsts and I only had a matter of days to learn
everything and make it, so while it might not be all that impressive, I'm very proud of what I was able to accomplish.
