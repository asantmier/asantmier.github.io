This is a 2D adventure game with classic turn-based RPG combat I made as a final project for "Media Device Architecture"
at Georgia Tech. This game is very unique in that it's made to run on the Game Boy Advance (or at least an emulator) with
all of the C code running directly on the hardware without any engine. I consider this short game complete and feel that
it is an excellent showcase of my abilities since I'm proud of my work on everything: the rendering, gameplay design, 
performance optimization, and how the art and sound complements the experience.

In Tuna Summoner you control a submarine on an adventure into the deep sea to find and defeat the legendary Tuna God.
On your journey you fight fish you come across and can even capture ones you weaken in combat to join your team. Hidden
around the map there are also power ups for your submarine that make it stronger in battle as well a deadly traps that
can sink you if you're not careful. The aesthetic and gameplay design are inspired by a few games including Subnautica, 
Shin Megami Tensei, and Yakuza's fishing minigame, which are also where the music is sourced from. The hardest part of 
this game was getting it to run well on the GBA's hardware and I'm very proud of how well designed and optimized my code
is considering I had no prior experience with hardware programming or C. This game was also quite ambitious and finishing
it in time was a massive challenge that required weeks of nonstop work that, unfortunately, were never possible for any of
my other projects, hence the quality of this one.

You can try the game with any GBA emulator or at

(Note: The web version of the emulator has a weird issue with audio popping. The GBA does sound bad, but not *that* bad. Sorry about that!)
