This is a 3D racing game based on an early prototype of Burnin' Rubber! for a separate, CS focused game design class. This project is also a prototype made in Unity (C#) and while less mechanically complex, has some fancier visuals and makes use of AI navigation. The AI cars have physics based controls and more or less the same capabilities as the player so designing a solution for them to competently race around the track was a serious challenge.

The goal of the game is to complete three laps around one of two race track options before your three AI opponents do. The driving system simulates tire wear which affects the grip of your wheels as you brake hard, drift, or otherwise create high friction on your tires. This means that as the race goes on, things get more chaotic as drivers start to lose control of their vehicles more often and good driving is the key to not losing control and crashing. There are also powerups around the track to sabotage your opponents or speed up yourself. The gameplay is not as complex as Burnin' Rubber, but is designed to be entertaining and chaotic, giving anyone the chance to win, even the admittedly-not-very-smart AI!
