A turn-based singleplayer strategy game in top down 3D where you connect shipping lines between islands, connecting as many routes as possible before pirates stop you.

This was my entry for [Kenny Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2024), which was my first game jam . The theme was "connection" with a limit of 2 days to make and only using assets from the host.

Inspired by Ticket to Ride, but for a single player. Routes are randomly chosen to be blocked off each turn to disrupt your plans for connecting islands, simulating playing against someone else. You draw goals of islands to connect like in the boardgame, but if the goals you draw aren't possible anymore because of the pirates, the game ends. The reasoning behind the goals determining the end of the game is that otherwise all games would be the same length, or always end with a fully connected map, or get exponentially easier with time. By ending the game based on the card draw it can end at any time, adding some variation to the flow.

Aside from being my first game jam this is also the first game I've finished using Godot, so there was a lot of firsts and a lot of learning here. Given the circumstances, I'm satisfied with the quality of the prototype and glad to have had the experience.
