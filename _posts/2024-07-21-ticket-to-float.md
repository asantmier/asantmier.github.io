A turn-based singleplayer strategy game in top down 3D where you connect shipping lines between islands, connecting as many routes as possible before pirates stop you.

This was my entry for [Kenny Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2024), which was my first game jam . The theme was "connection" with a limit of 2 days to make and only using assets from the host.

Inspired by Ticket to Ride but rather than using regular solitaire rules, routes are randomly chosen to be blocked off. Rather than having a limited number of trains, the game simply ends when you get a request you cannot complete.

I didn't have enough time to add any cool mechanics, but the core gameplay loop and overall concept is all there, so I'm satisfied with the prototype. This is the first game I've finished in Godot and my first game jam, so a lot of this was a learning experience and a little stressful, but it was an excellent opportunity to grow and refine my workflow.
