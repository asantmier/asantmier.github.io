title: B.I.G. Gun
---
> In a galaxy ruled by the Beam Intergalactic Society, safety is absolute, and freedom comes second. The Beam Intergalactic Gate (B.I.G.) is the only entry point into this utopia - a civilization of order, precision, and uncompromising laws. You are the B.I.G. gun, a new AI weapon training for the task of upholding these laws by inspecting and judging every ship that approaches the gate.

B.I.G. Gun is a 2D visual puzzle role playing game where you take the role of an AI controlled gun guarding the intergalatic border checkpoint: the B.I.G. Gate. Use your scanner to look inside ships and make sure nobody is breaking the daily law set by your owners, because its your job to kill anyone who breaks the law even if it means killing an entire ship full of potentially innocent people in the process. Refuse to be a good tool in the hands of your masters and face destruction, or follow the rules and get promoted.

This browser game was made using Godot engine in two weeks for the Pirate Software Game Jam 16 with the theme _"You Are The Weapon."_ I worked with three of my friends who had a little experience in game development related work. The three of them were divided into 3D art, UI art and writing, and sprite art while I organized the team, led our design, and did the in-engine development. Through collaborative effort and frequent meetings we were able to make a pretty enjoyable game that included all of our most important features.

We fit our game into the theme by literally making the player a weapon and so an important aspect of the design is selling the first person perspective of the gun. To make the player really feel like they embodied the weapon I spent a lot of time on the interface, interactions, sounds, and animations to make your identity have the mechanical feel of what we think of as weapons and the digital feel of an AI. Feeling like a weapon is a very important part of the game for me and every decision was made with that in mind. I felt that this perspective had potential as a moral exploration of loyalty and service (akin to Metal Gear) so we tried to convey those ideas in game text to pair with the gameplay.
