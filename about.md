Hi! My name is Allen and this website features a collection of my work relevent to game development and programming. You can find my [resume here](/assets/Resume.pdf), and my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allen-santmier-6a13042b0/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/asantmier) as well.

As a passionate game maker, I’m devoted to designing engaging experiences using unique mechanics and new tools. I thrive both in the creativity of design and the technical challenge of implementation and I’m always looking for unexplored ways to refine existing ideas.

I strongly believe all design should be focused on the quality of the user experience and every little mechanic should work with the user as they play with the experience. Challenge in games should serve to help the player grow and push them to play rather than serve as an obstacle always getting in their way. Games have tremendous potential and I strive to push the limits of what they can achieve with well-balanced and intuitive design.

In the many projects I was part of during my education, I served a key role in gameplay design and core implementation alongside teaching less experienced teammates. As a result, I have a lot of experience designing on the fly to meet constantly changing constraints and producing robust code and documentation.

Whether it be using a new technology or designing something outside of my comfort zone, with each project I try to challenge myself to learn something new. It’s my goal to always keep expanding my skills, and this motivation has made me a very fast learner, an excellent teacher, and a talented developer.
